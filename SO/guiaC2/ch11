11.9 Consider a file system that uses a modifed contiguous-allocation scheme
with support for extents. A file is a collection of extents, with each ex-
tent corresponding to a contiguous set of blocks. A key issue in such
systems is the degree of variability in the size of the extents. What are
the advantages and disadvantages of the following schemes:
    a. All extents are of the same size, and the size is predetermined.
   b. Extents can be of any size and are allocated dynamically.
    c. Extents can be of a few fixed sizes, and these sizes are predeter-
       mined.
Answer: If all extents are of the same size, and the size is predeter-
mined, then it simplifies the block allocation scheme. A simple bit map
or free list for extents would suffice. If the extents can be of any size and
are allocated dynamically, then more complex allocation schemes are
required. It might be difficult to find an extent of the appropriate size
and there might be external fragmentation. One could use the Buddy
system allocator discussed in the previous chapters to design an ap-
propriate allocator. When the extents can be of a few fixed sizes, and
these sizes are predetermined, one would have to maintain a separate
bitmap or free list for each possible size. This scheme is of intermediate
complexity and of intermediate flexibility in comparison to the earlier
schemes.

11.15 Consider a file system that uses inodes to represent files. Disk blocks
are 8 KB in size, and a pointer to a disk block requires 4 bytes. This file
system has 12 direct disk blocks, as well as single, double, and triple
indirect disk blocks. What is the maximum size of a file that ca be
stored in this file system?
