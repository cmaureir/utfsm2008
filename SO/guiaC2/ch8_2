8.4 Consider a logical address space of eight pages of 1024 words each,
mapped onto a physical memory of 32 frames.
a. How many bits are there in the logical address?
b. How many bits are there in the physical address?
Answer:
a. Logical address: 13 bits
b. Physical address: 15 bits

8.6 Describe a mechanism by which one segment could belong to the address
space of two different processes.
Answer: Since segment tables are a collection of baseâ€“limit registers,
segmentscanbesharedwhenentriesinthesegmenttableoftwodifferent
jobs point to the same physical location. The two segment tables must
have identical base pointers, and the shared segment number must be
the same in the two processes.

8.9 Explain the difference between internal and external fragmentation.
Internal fragmentation is the area ocupied by a process but can not be used by the process. This space is unusable by the system until the process release the space.
External fragmentation exists when total free memory is enough for the new process but it's not contiguous and can't satisfy the request.   Storage is fragmented into small holes.
