8.2 Consider a system in which a program can be separated into two parts:
code and data. The CPU knows whether it wants an instruction (in-
struction fetch) or data (data fetch or store). Therefore, two base–limit
register pairs are provided: one for instructions and one for data. The
instruction base–limit register pair is automatically read-only, so pro-
grams can be shared among different users. Discuss the advantages and
disadvantages of this scheme.

Answer: The major advantage of this scheme is that it is an effective
mechanism for code and data sharing. For example, only one copy of an
editor or a compiler needs to be kept in memory, and this code can be
shared by all processes needing access to the editor or compiler code.
Another advantage is protection of code against erroneous modification.
The only disadvantage is that the code and data must be separated,
which is usually adhered to in a compiler-generated code.
